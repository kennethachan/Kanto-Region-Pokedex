### **_Description_**

#### I propose to create a pokedex using pokemon API. The site would contain the first 150 pokemon from the kanto region. The site will have 2 buttons. The site will have a search to type and find pokemon with stats. And another button to generate a random pokemon if someone is not too familiar with the series. The middle of the screen will showcase the pokemon along with stats.

### **_Technologies_**

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Pokemon API

### **_MVP_**

#### HTML will be structured to include heading, buttons, search bar and divs for images and stats.

#### Basic CSS styling to position elements in a relative order. Styling to be prioritized after javascript logic is completed.

#### Import pokemon API to javascript. Generate important stat information including: pokemon name, pokemon image, type, HP, weakness. Include on click events to perform random generator button and search button.
